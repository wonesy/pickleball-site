      <strong>Reporting Match Results</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The HOME team is responsible for submitting match outcomes</li>
        <li>40 points are awarded if a player wins the match</li>
        <li>20 points are awarded if a player wins at least one game</li>
        <li>10 points are awarded if a player participates</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Tracking Progress and Standings</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Standings are based on match points</li>
        <li>Each player also has a Pickleball Rating (PBR) which is the percentage of games won</li>
        <li>PBR is used as a tiebreaker for match points and will eventually be used to group players into
          different leagues</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br> <!-- Space between list items -->
    <li>
      <strong>Playoffs and Championship</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Players are seeded based on their regular season performance</li>
        <li>The top two teams get a bye</li>
        <li>The league champion gets bragging rights and some type of prize</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
